## Project - A Format Checking Software for the Theses of BOUN Grad Students
Institute of Graduate Studies in Science and Engineering has some rules for theses. Some thesis writers can use Word, Pages, or LaTeX while following these rules. Some rules can be applied easily in LaTeX, while others in Word. The author might overlook some rules. Authors submit their theses in PDF format, and a human expert checks these documents against the formatting rules. The expert can also overlook the rule violations while checking. This software aims to automate the identification of formatting errors in PDF documents to increase review efficiency.
