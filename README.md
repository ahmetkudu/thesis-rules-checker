## CmpE 492 Fall 2023

## Description 
Welcome to our github repository for Bogazici University's term project course, CmpE492. For further information, please see our Wiki page.

## Project - A Format Checking Software for the Theses of BOUN Grad Students
BOUN Grad Institute has certain formatting rules for theses. Some of these rules are reflected in the latex template, some aren’t. Students submit their theses in PDF format and a human expert checks these documents against the formatting rules.

The aim of this software is to automatically identify the formatting errors in the PDF document. This can be done in two ways:

* The latex source can be parsed and analysed. <br/>
* The PDF file can be analysed.<br/>

Our aim is to implement a combination of the strategies mentioned above, identify and propose fixes for the formatting errors.
